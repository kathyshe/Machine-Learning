Introduction:
In the field of Machine Learning, the performance of a model is crucial. To assess the performance of a model, there are several metrics that are used. One of these important metrics is the Confusion Matrix, which is used to evaluate the accuracy of a model. The Confusion Matrix is a matrix with size n x n, where n represents the number of class labels in a given problem. The purpose of the Confusion Matrix is to provide a clear picture of the model's performance in a tabular format.
